# Structured vs Unstructured Input

`Structured Input` : Structure Input is a type of natural language prompt that is `clear, specific, and formatted in a way that directly tells the model what task to perfrom and how to respond`. 

**Key Feature** : 

- Precise Instructions
- Often includes format and or constraints.
- Easier for model interpret and follow.

1. `Translate "hello" into French` : A direct command clearly telling the model what to do : `Translation task`.

2. `Write a Python Function to Validate email address` : A specific coding task with clear outupt expectations.

3. `Tell me A Joke About Cats` : Straightforward request for a joke, specifying the topic.


# Unstructured Input

`Unstructured Input` : Unstructure Input is a type of natural language input that is `more conversational, vague or open-ended`. It does not clearly specific the exact task or format the model should follow.

**Key Feature** : 

- Natural and human-like language.
- Less direct or specific.

1. `How do you say hello in French?` : A question form, still asking for translation, but less direct.

2. `How can I check if an email address is valid using Python?`:  Asking for help or explanation, not giving direct command.

3. `I'd love to hear a funny cat joke` : Express interest formally, but same intent as structured one.
